# [Magnitude](https://github.com/plasticityai/magnitude) Fork that reduces dependencies

This repository has a couple dependency changes to the excellent Magnitude project. The Torch, AllenNLP (ELMo) and Annoy dependencies are removed. This simplifies the library to only support Word2Vec, GloVe and fastText embeddings. most_similar_approx methods are removed but all other functionality is retained.

See Magnitude project for more information and links to pre-trained models: https://github.com/plasticityai/magnitude
